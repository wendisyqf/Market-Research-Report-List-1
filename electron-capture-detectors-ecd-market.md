<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electron Capture Detectors (ECD) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radioactive Electron Capture Detector</li><li>Non-radioactive Electron Capture Detector</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electron Capture Detectors (ECD) are sensitive analytical devices used in gas chromatography to detect electron-accepting compounds, such as halogenated substances. Two main types of ECDs exist: radioactive and non-radioactive. Radioactive ECDs utilize a radioactive source, typically tritium or nickel-63, to ionize the carrier gas, allowing for enhanced sensitivity. Non-radioactive ECDs employ alternative methods, such as cold discharge or chemical ionization, to achieve detection without radioactivity. Both types are crucial for environmental monitoring and analytical chemistry applications.</p></p>
